I am the stone that the builder refused<br>
I am the visual, the inspiration<br>
That made Lady sing the blues<br>

I'm the spark that makes your idea bright<br>
The same spark that lights the dark<br>
So that you can know your left from your right<br>


I am the ballot in your box, the bullet in the gun<br>
The inner glow that lets you know to call your brother son<br>
The story that just begun, the promise of what's to come<br>
And I'mma remain a soldier till the war is won<br>
