I am the stone that the builder refused

I am the visual, the inspiration

That made Lady sing the blues


I'm the spark that makes your idea bright

The same spark that lights the dark

So that you can know your left from your right


I am the ballot in your box, the bullet in the gun

The inner glow that lets you know to call your brother son

The story that just begun, the promise of what's to come

And I'mma remain a soldier till the war is won
